# Tech Challenge for Full Stack Engineer

For this challenge you will need to code a simple newsletter sending app. The app should consist of both front and back end.

You can either make completely separate components (like a SPA + a REST api) or a front plus back combo (for example, a PHP website that can be both the UI and send the newsletters).

### The following functionality will be evaluated
- Admin user can upload a pdf or png image (the newsletter)
- Admin user can submit an email list of recipients of the newsletter 
- Admin user can click a button to trigger the newsletter submission
- PDF of png document should be attached to the email
- Recipient user can click a "unsubscribe" link contained in the email, the user should not receive any more emails.


### Bonus points
- Email is personalized and using html format
- Recipient user can opt for only unsuscribe from specific newsletters
- A statistics dashboard is provided (number of sent mails, number of recipients, etc.)
